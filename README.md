# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a full-stack task management application I built as part of this take-home assignment. It lets users register, create projects, manage tasks, and track progress - backed by a proper REST API with authentication, relational data modelling, and a responsive UI that tries to feel closer to a real product than a code exercise.

**Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
**API:** [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

---

## Overview

I aimed to ship something I'd actually be comfortable putting in front of users, not just something that satisfies the spec on paper. That meant going beyond the minimum: the UI supports inline task editing, a dedicated task detail page, debounced server-side assignee search, and optimistic state updates that avoid unnecessary round-trips. All of this is covered in more detail in the Architecture Decisions section.

The core flows are all covered: registration and login with JWTs, full project and task CRUD, status filtering, assignee management, and a clean responsive layout across mobile and desktop.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite |
| **UI Components** | shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind CSS) |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + PostCSS |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express + TypeScript |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 |
| **Auth** | JWT (24-hour expiry) + bcryptjs (cost 12) |
| **Containerization** | Docker + Docker Compose |

---

## Running Locally

The only prerequisite is Docker. Everything else — Node, PostgreSQL, migrations, seed data — runs inside the containers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskflow
cd taskflow
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```

That's all. On first boot, the API container automatically runs migrations and seeds the database. Once you see both services healthy in the logs, the app is ready:

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **API:** http://localhost:3001

Startup typically takes around 10 seconds for PostgreSQL to finish initialising.

---

## Test Credentials

A test account is created during seeding so you can explore the app immediately without registering:

```
Email:    test@example.com
Password: password123
```

The seed also creates a project with a few tasks in different states so you can see the full UI without having to set anything up manually.

## Architecture Decisions

I want to be transparent about the choices I made and why, rather than just listing the stack.

### Node.js/Express over Go

The assignment listed Go as preferred, and I considered it. I chose Node/Express because the entire stack is then one language — TypeScript end to end. That means a single mental model for types, error handling, and async patterns. If this were a high-throughput service processing thousands of concurrent connections, the calculus changes.

### Vite over Create React App

Straightforward call. Vite's dev build is meaningfully faster, HMR is near-instant, and the production bundle is leaner. CRA has been effectively deprecated and I wouldn't start a new project with it today.

### shadcn/ui for components

I chose shadcn/ui over MUI or Chakra because it's composable and unstyled at the primitive level — you get fully accessible Radix components that you style yourself with Tailwind. There's no runtime CSS-in-JS overhead, no theme system to fight, and the output looks like your design, not the library's. It's what teams like Vercel and Linear use in production, and I think it's the right default for new projects.

### Plain SQL migrations over an ORM

I went with raw SQL for migrations because they're transparent. Any engineer can read a `.sql` file, diff it, and understand exactly what changed. An ORM like Prisma is convenient during development but introduces a layer of abstraction between the code and the database that I think is easy to misuse, especially under time pressure.

### Stateless JWT authentication

Standard choice for a REST API. Tokens are self-contained, scale horizontally without session storage, and are straightforward to validate in middleware. The main limitation is revocation — you can't invalidate a token server-side without a denylist. For this scope, 24-hour expiry is a reasonable tradeoff and I've noted it explicitly rather than pretending it's not a limitation.

### Optimistic UI — no full reloads after mutations

Every task mutation (create, edit, status change, delete) updates local React state from the API response rather than re-fetching the entire project. This makes the UI feel responsive and eliminates unnecessary network traffic. The tradeoff is that concurrent edits by another user aren't reflected until navigation — acceptable without real-time support, and an honest limitation I'd address with WebSockets if this went further.

### Server-side user search for assignee autocomplete

Rather than loading all users into the client when a project page loads (which doesn't scale), the assignee input hits `GET /users/search?q=` with a 250ms debounce. The endpoint returns at most 50 results ordered by prefix relevance. This is the right architecture from day one, any real product has far more users than tasks, and front-loading all of them is a mistake you'd eventually have to fix.

### No real-time updates

WebSockets would make the product better, but they would also meaningfully increase the codebase, persistent connection management, reconnection logic, and server-side event fan-out. I made the call to build the core product solidly rather than ship a live-update feature that's half-done. It's at the top of my "what's next" list.

---

## API Reference

All endpoints return `Content-Type: application/json`. All endpoints except auth require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Authentication

**POST `/auth/register`**
```json
// Request
{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "password": "secure-password" }

// Response 201
{ "token": "eyJ...", "user": { "id": "uuid", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" } }
```

**POST `/auth/login`**
```json
// Request
{ "email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123" }

// Response 200
{ "token": "eyJ...", "user": { "id": "uuid", "name": "Test User", "email": "test@example.com" } }
```

### Projects

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/projects` | List projects the current user owns or has tasks in |
| POST | `/projects` | Create a project (owner = current user) |
| GET | `/projects/:id` | Project details + its tasks + related users |
| PATCH | `/projects/:id` | Update name/description (owner only) |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id` | Delete project + all tasks (owner only) |
| GET | `/projects/:id/stats` | Task counts by status and assignee |

### Tasks

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/projects/:id/tasks` | List tasks — supports `?status=` `?assignee=` `?page=` `?limit=` |
| GET | `/projects/:id/tasks/:taskId` | Single task + project metadata + related users |
| POST | `/projects/:id/tasks` | Create a task |
| PATCH | `/tasks/:id` | Sparse update — only changed fields are sent |
| DELETE | `/tasks/:id` | Delete (project owner or task creator only) |

### Users

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/users` | List all users |
| GET | `/users/search?q=<term>&limit=<n>` | Search users by name or email (max 50, prefix-ordered) |

---

## Error Handling

**Validation Error** (400)
```json
{
  "error": "validation failed",
  "fields": { "email": "is required" }
}
```

**Unauthorized** (401) — Missing or invalid token
```json
{ "error": "unauthorized" }
```

**Forbidden** (403) — Authenticated but not authorized (e.g., delete someone else's project)
```json
{ "error": "forbidden" }
```

**Not Found** (404)
```json
{ "error": "not found" }
```

---

## Database Schema

### `users`
```sql
id (UUID, PK)
name (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
email (VARCHAR, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, indexed)
password (VARCHAR, hashed with bcryptjs at cost ≥12)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### `projects`
```sql
id (UUID, PK)
name (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
description (TEXT, nullable)
owner_id (UUID, FK → users, indexed)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### `tasks`
```sql
id (UUID, PK)
title (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
description (TEXT, nullable)
status (ENUM: todo | in_progress | done, default: todo)
priority (ENUM: low | medium | high, default: medium)
project_id (UUID, FK → projects, indexed)
assignee_id (UUID, FK → users, nullable, indexed)
due_date (DATE, nullable)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)
updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

---

## Pages & Routes

| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/login` | `AuthPage` | Login form with validation and error feedback |
| `/register` | `AuthPage` | Registration form |
| `/projects` | `ProjectsPage` | List all accessible projects, create new |
| `/projects/:id` | `ProjectDetailPage` | Task board with status filter chips, task list, inline status toggle, create/edit/delete |
| `/projects/:id/tasks/:taskId` | `TaskDetailPage` | Full task detail view: inline editing, status/priority controls, metadata sidebar with assignee and creator |

Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`. Auth state is stored in `localStorage` and persists across page refreshes.

---

## What I'd Do With More Time

These aren't things I didn't think of, they're deliberate cuts to stay within the intended scope.

**Highest priority:**
- **Real-time updates** — WebSocket-based task sync so changes made by one user are immediately visible to others on the same project. The architecture is already set up for it; the missing piece is the connection layer.
- **Optimistic rollback on error** — Right now, if a mutation fails after the optimistic update, the local state stays wrong until a page reload. Adding a revert step would make this production-grade.
- **Request cancellation for search** — Stale debounced responses can currently overwrite newer results in the assignee input. A simple `AbortController` pattern fixes this.

**Also worth building:**
- Integration tests covering the auth and task CRUD flows end to end
- Role-based access: project member roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer) with a proper permission matrix
- An activity log so you can see who changed what and when
- Rate limiting on the API to prevent abuse
- A CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) that runs linting, type-check, and tests on every PR

I deliberately didn't include half-finished versions of any of these. A solid, working core is more useful to review than a lot of features that are 80% done.

---

## Bonus Features

Beyond the required spec, I also shipped:

- **Pagination** on task and project list endpoints (`?page=` and `?limit=`)
- **Stats endpoint** — `GET /projects/:id/stats` with task counts by status and assignee
- **Single-task fetch** — `GET /projects/:id/tasks/:taskId` returns only the data that page actually needs, instead of fetching the whole project
- **Server-side assignee search** — `GET /users/search?q=` with 250ms debounce and prefix-ordered results; no bulk user loading
- **Inline task editing** — full task detail page with editable fields, not just a modal
- **Optimistic UI** — create, edit, status change, and delete all update local state instantly from the API response; no round-trip fetches
- **Sparse PATCH** — task updates only send the fields that actually changed
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM handling so containers stop cleanly
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** — production images are minimal
- **Structured logging** with Pino
- **Global 401 handling** — Axios interceptor catches expired tokens and redirects to login automatically

---

## Development Workflow

If you want to work on the code locally outside Docker:

```bash
# Run migrations after schema changes
docker compose exec api npm run migrate:up

# Reseed the database
docker compose exec api npm run seed

# Access PostgreSQL directly
docker compose exec postgres psql -U taskflow -d taskflow
```

Backend changes reload automatically with ts-node-dev. Frontend changes hot-reload via Vite.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect to database"** — PostgreSQL takes around 10 seconds to be ready on cold start. Docker Compose healthchecks handle this automatically. If you're running services manually, start postgres first and give it a moment before starting the API.

**"Port 3000 already in use"** — Update the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "3100:3000"
```

**"Migrations didn't run"** — Check the API logs:
```bash
docker compose logs api
```

**"Seed user not found"** — Verify the seed ran successfully:
```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U taskflow -d taskflow -c "SELECT email FROM users;"
```

---

## Security

- Passwords hashed with bcryptjs at cost 12
- JWTs signed with a secret loaded from `.env`, never hardcoded
- CORS restricted to `localhost:3000`
- All database queries parameterised — no string interpolation
- `.env` is `.gitignore`d; `.env.example` with safe defaults is committed instead
- Token expiry set to 24 hours
